                    The Lives and Times of the Resigned
                </header>
                <p>
                    In a future near you, where life is post - scarcity and technology has excelled beyond the perception of slowness, a new phenomenon has swept away 37 % of the total human population into a state of permanent resignation, whereby they are removed from all direct human to human communication and now choose to live within nearly boundless forests of their own fantasies and simulacra.
                    <br><br>
                    What follow are the lives, times, and situations of those who have resigned from life.

                    Sentiment & Oblivion
                </header>
                <p>
                    This is a book full of pessimistic fragments and aphorisms touching on topics such as: individuality
                    and introversion, misanthropy, feelings and laundry, work and slavery, life's uselessness,
                    antinatalism, moral nihilism, political ideas and ideals, freedom, suicide, atheism, naturalism,
                    dying and the hereafter, general nihilism about purpose but not Truth, rationalism,
                    anti-correlationism, futility, collapse, the nonexistence of free will, moral responsibility,
                    philosophy, values, anti-rights, writing, thoughts around both neorationalism and the dark
                    enlightenment, and all that kind of thing.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from pessimism, if there is a general theme, then it would be exploring and thinking through
                    the relationship between groups and individuals. Many will find parts of this book terribly rash and
                    distasteful, because it stands against so many firmly held beliefs and common moral ideas.
                    <br><br>
                    Regarding politics: Humanistic, libral, or socialistically inclined leftist readers may find this
                    book utterly revolting. Rightwing readers and religious folk will most likely feel let down too.
                    Centrists, sensitive moralists, and dogmatic anti-extremists should probably not bother. Some common
                    stances appearing in several fragments are: universalism, anti-tradition, anti-identitarianism,
                    anti-particularism, anti-relativism, anti-decoloniality, non-racialism, libertarian ideals, and
                    flirtations with communism and xenofeminism.
                    <br><br>
                    For a better picture, while certainly not as good, in terms of style and structure the book is
                    something raw and informal taking inspiration from personalities like Fernando Pessoa (personality
                    and hypocrisy), Emil Cioran (futility and melodrama), and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals
                    (structure, hammering, and topics of focus).

                    Morsels for the Depressed, Depraved, Pessimistic, and otherwise declining
                </header>
                <p>
                    Aphorisms, Fragments, and Flash fiction, also some poetry,
                    for all who are lost and not particularly looking to be found.
                    <br><br>
                    There are morsels touching on: Nihilism, Pessimism, Misanthropy, Antinatalism,
                        Free Will, Futility, Collapse, Doom, Gloom, Morality and Moral Nihilism,
                        Philosophy, Sappy feelings and getting hurt,
                        Art, as well as rough and dirty speculations on this and that.
                    <br><br>
                    Morsels is my first book, and it is in all honesty, a bit rough around the edges.If you want something a little meatier and less naive, then perhaps
                    try my second book of fragments called "Pessimisticities, Nihilisms, & Politics!", which is an awkward title to be sure, but as a book it has substance to it.
                    <br><br>
                    Morsels has two sections to it: the first section is purely aphorisms, and the second section is a mix of short flash fiction dialogues, fragments, and poetry.
